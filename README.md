##Models Being Explored

For this project I’ll be looking at what machine learning algorithm does best for determining what chemicals cause Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The current models being evaluated are:

Logistic Regression
LDA 
Conditional Decision Trees
Random Forest
Lasso/Ridge
k-Nearest Neighbors
Support Vector Machine
Neural Networks
More models may be considered if time allows

##Model Evaluation

To determine the best model I’ll use a mix of comparing AIC as well as using cross validation. AIC will be used to determine how well the model does superficially. Cross validation will be used for fundamentally determining what model does best. I plan to use a ratio of 10% of the data to be the test set and the remaining 90% to be the holdout set.
